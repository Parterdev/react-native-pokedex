## Description
This project is a new practical item of my React Native mobile app series that made with:
 - react native v0.66.0
 - [stack-navigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/) - (to make transitions between screens)
 - [react-navigation/material-bottom-tabs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/material-bottom-tab-navigator/) - (material-design themed tab bar on the bottom)
 - [react-native-tab-view](https://github.com/satya164/react-native-tab-view) - (to slide different components and screens in a single view)
 - [react-native-image-colors](https://github.com/osamaqarem/react-native-image-colors) - (to get primary colors from an image)
 - [react-native-elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) - (UI Toolkit for RN apps)
 - [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) - (UI buttons and logos)
 - [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - (Promise HTTP package)
   
 - Of course, I used things like custom hooks, components, helpers, navigator and custom react native tabs .
